# NodeJS and Browser SDK

## Technologies

- ES6
- TAPE for unit tests
- [MonoRepo approach](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/development/doc/design/monorepo.md)
- As simple as possible

## Development mode

Execute `./scripts/development.sh` and just continue editing code without worry. In background you will have all the
babel commands which transpiles `es6` folder and `test/es6`. Transpiled code will be available inside `src/` folder
at the same level as the original transpiled code.

For more information, just take a look to the script code.
