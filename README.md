## Compatibility
The JavaScript SDK is an isomorphic library for both Node.js and Web browser environments.

It supports Node.js version 4.x or later, and can be used in all major browsers. However, not all browsers have native support for the used APIs, such as ES6 Promises. The standard solution for this is to use [polyfills](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise). 

## Getting started

Below is a simple Node.js example that describes the instantiation and most basic usage of our SDK:
```javascript
// Import the SDK
var SplitFactory = require('@splitsoftware/splitio').SplitFactory;

// Instantiate the SDK
var factory = SplitFactory({
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
});

// Get the client instance you'll use
var client = factory.client();

// Set a callback to listen for the SDK_READY event, to make sure the SDK is properly loaded before asking it for a treatment
client.on(client.Event.SDK_READY, function() {
  var treatment = client.getTreatment('CUSTOMER_ID', 'SPLIT_NAME');
  if (treatment == 'on') {
      // insert code here to show on treatment
  } else if (treatment == 'off') {
      // insert code here to show off treatment
  } else {
      // insert your control treatment code here
  }
});
```
